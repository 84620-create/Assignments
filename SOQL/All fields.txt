Q. How to fetch all fields from object in SOQL ?

Ans: You can now include any of these in the field list:

FIELDS(ALL)—to select all the fields of an object.
FIELDS(CUSTOM)—to select all the custom fields of an object.
FIELDS(STANDARD)—to select all the standard fields of an object.

In each case, FIELDS() respects field-level security so it only shows the fields that you have permission to access.

# You can use FIELDS() as the complete field list. For example:

SELECT FIELDS(ALL) FROM Account LIMIT 200
SELECT FIELDS(CUSTOM) FROM Account LIMIT 200
SELECT FIELDS(STANDARD) FROM Account

Queries :
1. SELECT Id, FIELDS(ALL) FROM User LIMIT 200
2. SELECT Name, Id, FIELDS(CUSTOM) FROM Account LIMIT 200
3. SELECT someCustomField__c, FIELDS(STANDARD) FROM Account
